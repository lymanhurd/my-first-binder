    "The purpose of this course is to illustrate that simple programs can lead to complicated results.  In fact, some of the systemss we will be conisidering are provably as complicated as a general computer.  All of the calculations we will carry out could be done with pencil and paper, but to speed things up we will be implementing the code in Python."

    "### Jupyter Notebooks and Python Basics\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook which is a way to present Python code (it works for other computer languages too, but we will stick to Python in this course) in an interactive fashion.  There aree Markdown sections which are just explanatory text, input boxes which represent code and output boxes that represent the result of running the code.  In all cases you can edit the code and see what the new values would have given by simply changing the tesxt and hitting \"shift-enter\" to evaluate the cell.  Note that the Python program underlying the notebook only knows about cells you have evaluated and so you should be sure to evaluate cells in the desired order (in other words, if we define a variable or function in one cell, we cannot use that information in a subsequent cell until we have evaluated the first cell).\n",

    "### Evaluating expressions\n",
    "First off, Python acts like a glorified calculator.  You can simply type in an expression and get a result.  The **print** function here is not technically necessary because Python will always print the result of the last expression it sees, but we will want to use this later when we want Pythont to print out value sin the middle of a computation."

The range by default starts at 0 and goes upwards but with two numbers you can specify the lower and upper bounds, and with three you can even specify the step between values.  We combine this with the `for` keyword.  Note that spacing tells Python what statements we want looped over (we will also see his rule when we evaluate `if/else` statements).
